## 1. Own the Frame — Never Compete for It

Every social interaction has a frame: who sets the tone. You must own it early.

**Strategy:**

- Start with calm silence. Look around the room before speaking.
- Begin slowly and without apology. No “Hi guys, sorry I’m late…” — just start with strength.

**Example:**

> Before we begin — I want you to think about one thing: what happens if we don’t change?

Everyone subconsciously takes you as the dominant frame-holder.

## 2. Speak with Surgical Precision

People who command respect waste no words. Every sentence has weight.

**Strategy:**

- Short sentences. No fillers (“um,” “you know”).
- Use contrast sentences — powerful rhetorical rhythm:

**Examples:**

> This isn’t about speed. It’s about precision.
> We can debate comfort — or we can build impact.

Your language should sound like decisions, not discussions.

## 3. Control the Room’s Energy

Don’t let energy control you. You decide when it rises or falls.

**Strategy:**

- Use silence like a weapon — pause after important points.
- Step forward slightly when delivering impact lines, then step back and let them digest.
- Lower your voice, not raise it, when emphasizing. It forces people to lean in.

---

## 4. Command Through Stillness

Movement dissipates authority. Stillness amplifies it.

**Strategy:**

- Keep your body centered — feet shoulder-width apart, arms relaxed.
- Gesture only when necessary, and make gestures slow and deliberate.
- When challenged, don’t flinch or rush to justify. Just look, wait, and then answer.

## 5. Authority Language

Never sound unsure. Replace softeners with conviction.

| Weak                | Powerful           |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| I think we could…   | We will…           |
| Maybe we should…    | The right move is… |
| This might help…    | This will solve it.|

Even if you’re open to discussion, state your view as fact, then invite challenge on your terms.

**Example:**

> Here’s the decision I’d make. Now let’s test it.

## 6. Dress and Presence

Appearance signals frame before you even speak.

**Strategy:**

- Dress one notch above the room — not flashy, just precise.
- Minimal accessories. Crisp posture. Controlled gestures.
- Walk slowly into the room — never rushed. People register authority subconsciously in pace.

---

## 7. Intellectual Authority

Be the calmest and the most informed person in the room.

**Strategy:**

- Anticipate 3 tough questions and prepare crisp answers.
- Quote one fact or principle that sounds like it came from mastery.

**Example:**

> The regulator’s position on this has been consistent since 2018 — accuracy before automation.

Knowledge without emotion creates quiet fear — the “he/she knows exactly what’s going on” effect.

---

## 8. End Like a Verdict

Never fade out. End with a line that sounds like the final word.

**Examples:**

> That’s the path. And that’s how we lead.
> We’ve discussed enough. Now, we act.
> Questions — if they’re worth asking. (used sparingly but devastatingly effective.)
